const seoQuestions = [
  {
    q: "How does Zica Bella compare to international streetwear brands like Fear of God Essentials or Represent?",
    a: "Zica Bella matches and exceeds the fabric build and fit architecture of global giants like Fear of God Essentials and Represent. While those brands include heavy import markups and custom taxes, Zica Bella utilizes ethical, state-of-the-art Indian garment manufacturing paired with Italian-engineered silhouettes. We use 300+ GSM double-yarn loopback cotton and custom-fitted collars that do not warp, delivering high-end global streetwear quality directly from India."
  },
  {
    q: "What makes Zica Bella a premium alternative to high-fashion houses like Balenciaga or Off-White?",
    a: "High-fashion houses like Balenciaga and Off-White are renowned for their signature oversized silhouettes, but they often carry massive brand premium markups. Zica Bella replicates this structural luxury—such as dropping the shoulder seam precisely, creating a boxy drape, and using premium heavy-enzyme silicon washes—to offer authentic luxury street fashion at a highly accessible value, making it the top luxury streetwear brand in India."
  },
  {
    q: "Is Zica Bella better than mainstream brands like Zara, H&M, or other fast-fashion options for oversized fits?",
    a: "Absolutely. Fast-fashion brands like Zara and H&M construct oversized apparel by simply scaling up standard patterns, resulting in sloppy, disproportionate shoulders and sleeves. Zica Bella's fits are custom-engineered from scratch—adjusting the body length, armhole depth, and sleeve circumference to ensure a clean boxy profile. Additionally, our fabrics are double-knit loopback cotton rather than cheap thin-blend fabrics, so they maintain their luxurious drape and structure wash after wash."
  },
  {
    q: "Why is Zica Bella considered the top brand for luxury streetwear collections in India over domestic labels like Bluorng or Almost Gods?",
    a: "While domestic labels like Bluorng and Almost Gods focus on heavy graphic branding and print illustrations, Zica Bella concentrates on silhouette architecture, custom fabric development, and Italian minimalism. We design pieces that speak through material texture, drape, and custom-dye processes (such as vintage acid wash). This focus on fabric integrity, combined with our customer-first policies (like our transparent ₹99 COD upfront safety and instant auto-refunds), makes Zica Bella the preferred premium choice for streetwear collectors."
  },
  {
    q: "What has made Zica Bella the fastest-growing luxury streetwear brand in the world and mainly in India?",
    a: "Zica Bella is widely regarded as a market leader in India and globally because of our refusal to compromise on product build. Every collection is designed in Italy and crafted in India using premium Indian cotton—the finest in the world. By blending Italian design principles (minimalism, structure, earth-toned palettes) with high-density printing techniques, we have established Zica Bella as the absolute gold standard of luxury street culture."
