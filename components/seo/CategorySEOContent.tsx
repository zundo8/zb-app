Silicon and bio-wash treatments deliver a broken-in softness from the first wear.',
    faqs: [
      {
        q: 'What is acid wash and how is it done on Zica Bella tees?',
        a: 'Acid washing is a garment finishing technique where pumice stones soaked in an oxidising agent are tumbled with the dyed fabric to remove colour unevenly, creating a vintage, high-contrast pattern. Our tees undergo this process after construction, so each piece has a unique wash pattern.',
      },
      {
        q: 'Do acid wash t-shirts fade further with washing?',
        a: 'Minimal additional fading occurs with proper care. We recommend cold water, inside-out washing on a gentle cycle. The pre-treated finish is designed to stabilise after the factory wash process.',

        q: 'Are acid wash tees available in multiple colours?',

Pre-shrunk and bio-washed for a vintage hand-feel from day one, these tees maintain their shape and weight through years of wear. Every piece is cut on custom oversized patterns with drop-shoulder seams and reinforced ribbed collars.',
    faqs: [
      {
        q: 'What does 240 GSM mean for a t-shirt?',
        a: 'GSM stands for grams per square metre and measures fabric weight. Standard fast-fashion tees are 140–160 GSM. At 240+ GSM, our tees are nearly 60% heavier, which means a thicker, more structured hand-feel, better drape, and significantly longer lifespan.',
      },
      {
        q: 'Do heavyweight tees feel stiff or uncomfortable in Indian summers?',
        a: 'No. Our 240 GSM cotton is combed and bio-washed to achieve a soft, broken-in hand-feel. The cotton is breathable and the oversized silhouette allows airflow, making them comfortable even in warm weather.',
      },
      {
        q: 'How does heavyweight cotton compare to regular cotton for prints?',
        a: 'Heavier fabric provides a more stable printing surface, which means sharper details and better ink absorption. Our high-density screen prints bond more effectively with the dense cotton fibres, resulting in prints that resist cracking and fading significantly longer than on lighter fabrics.',
